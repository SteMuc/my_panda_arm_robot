# controller_manager provides the necessary infrastructure to manage multiple controllers efficiently and robustly using ROS 2 Control.
controller_manager:
  ros__parameters:
    update_rate: 500 # update_rate specifies how often (in Hz) the controllers should be updated.

    # The JointTrajectoryController allows you to send joint trajectory commands to a group 
    # of joints on a robot. These commands specify the desired positions for each joint.     
    arm_controller:
      type: joint_trajectory_controller/JointTrajectoryController

    # Responsible for publishing the current state of the robot's joints to the /joint_states 
    # ROS 2 topic
    joint_state_broadcaster:
      type: joint_state_broadcaster/JointStateBroadcaster

# Define the parameters for each controller
arm_controller:

    joints:
      - panda_joint1
      - panda_joint2
      - panda_joint3
      - panda_joint4
      - panda_joint5
      - panda_joint6
      - panda_joint7

    # The controller will expect position commands as input for each of these joints.
    command_interfaces:
      - position
    
    # Tells the controller that it should expect to receive position data as the state 
    # feedback from the hardware interface,
    state_interfaces:
      - position
      - velocity

    state_publish_rate: 50.0 # Defaults to 50
    action_monitor_rate: 20.0 # Defaults to 20

    allow_partial_joints_goal: false # Defaults to false
    # If true, When set to true, the controller will not use any feedback from the system 
    # (e.g., joint positions, velocities, efforts) to compute the control commands. 
    open_loop_control: true
    allow_integration_in_goal_trajectories: true
    # When set to true, it allows the controller to integrate the trajectory goals it receives. 
    # This means that if the goal trajectory only specifies positions, the controller will 
    # numerically integrate the positions to compute the velocities and accelerations required 
    # to follow the trajectory.
    constraints:
      stopped_velocity_tolerance: 0.0 # Defaults to 0.01
      goal_time: 0.0 # Defaults to 0.0 (start immediately)
